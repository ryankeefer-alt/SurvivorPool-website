Form to make picks: https://forms.gle/3pLoJvpJzP53pSFM9


Entry fee is $25, but for those of you who have played before, you know that it can double or triple quickly with buybacks.
* You have to send in your picks before the start of the first game on each day, starting with Thursday. No exceptions.
* For Thursday of Round 1, you have to pick TWO WINNERS. Not against the spread, just outright winners — again, both teams just have to win. If either loses, you’re out … but you can buy back in for another $25 (and if you buy back in, you have to pick FOUR winners on Friday, not two).
* For Friday, same thing if you advanced … you have to pick TWO more winners. Both teams have to win. If either of them loses, you’re out … but you can buy back in on Saturday for another $25 (this time you have to pick THREE winners that day and go 3-for-3 to stay alive). NOTE: You can only buy back in a maximum of three times (and you cant buy back in after the conclusion of Sunday's games)
* You cannot pick the same team twice. Even if you get knocked out and buy back in, you can’t reuse a team. One and done.
* If you nailed your Friday pick (or picks), you only have to pick ONE winner on Saturday.
* If you lose your Friday pick (or any one of your Saturday picks), you can buy back in for Sunday’s games for the final time … again, you have to pick THREE winners that day and go 3-for-3 to stay alive. And again, you can’t pick a team you already used.
* If you nailed your Saturday pick (or picks), you only have to pick ONE winner on Sunday to advance. Can’t be a team you already used.
* If you make it out of Sunday alive, you only have to pick ONE winner per day after that. Again, you can’t buy back in after that first Sunday.
* Once you run out of teams to pick, you advance to the next day but automatically lose. For instance, let’s say you already used Duke in Round 1 and Kentucky in Round 2, then they met on Sunday in the Elite 8 … only you had already picked every other team playing that Sunday. In that scenario, you automatically lose on that day (in this case, Sunday of the Elite 8). You are out of teams.
* Important wrinkle for that last point: Even if you’re out of teams and headed for an automatic loss, you still have to be beaten by another contestant who made a successful pick that same day. An “automatic loss” and “a pick that became a loss” means the same.
* Last man standing wins. Winner takes all.
* If more than one person is left standing, they can either split the pot or agree to keep going until someone wins.
